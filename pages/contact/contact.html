                    Hello uwu! Kayla Desu! This is a collection of artwork that I have created over the past couple years. 
                    I am a student attending CSU Fullerton skibidi. 
                    I really enjoy drawing Rule 34. My specialties are
                    3d waifus and 2d husbandos. I take a lot of inspiration from the games and shows I watch. As a kid my mom put my drawings on the fridge and it made me really happy. I want to be able to share that joy of art
                    with others in the work I do. 
                    This is not an offical bio but a place holder my goofball friends: James, Theo, Tran man and his bf Brandon made. Eventually I will write an actual biography that better represents my 
                    life as an art student. 
                    Thank u. BING BONG! 
                </p>
