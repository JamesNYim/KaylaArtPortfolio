            Hello uwu! Kayla Desu! This is a collection of artwork that I have created over the past couple years. I am a student attending CSU Fullerton skibidi. I really enjoy drawing Rule 34. My specialties are
            3d waifus and 2d husbandos. I take a lot of inspiration from the games and shows I watch. As a kid my mom put my drawings on the fridge and it made me really happy. I want to be able to share that joy of art
            with others in the work I do. This is not an offical bio but a place holder my goofball friends: James, Theo, Tran man and his bf Brandon made. Eventually I will write an actual biography that better represents my 
            life as an art student. Thank u. BING BONG! 
            </p>
